# BibleCitations
Welcome to the Git repository of a case study on searching Bible citations within czech press of 1925-1939. This is a part of DL4DH project.
See [web of DL4DH on nkp.cz](https://dl4dh.nkp.cz) for more information and results of the project (to be published by the end of September 2022)

- The script that is published here does not include all of the data available to replicate the case study. This is due to copyright both on journals material and some of the Biblical tranlsations.
- Nonetheless, the script can be used on your own material. It can be modified in any way and you can also add your own Biblical translations should you have access to them.

## Available tranlsations of Bible
- Following translations are freely available in this repository:
    - Bible Kralická (BKR) - Old and New Testament, see [Bible Kralická on obohu.cz](https://obohu.cz/bible/index.php?k=Gn&kap=1&styl=BKR)
    - Translation of Jan Hejčl (HEJCL) - Old Testament + Deuterocanonical books, see [translation of Jan Hejčl on obohu.cz](https://obohu.cz/bible/index.php?styl=HEJCL&k=Gn&kap=1)

- We have also worked with an incomplete translation of "Bible Svatováclavská" that was provided us by prof. [Pavel Kosek from the Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/lide/4755-pavel-kosek) but we do not have a permission to make this one public.
