            <p class="p-header">The charts presented here serve as an exploratory online ‘Religious Studies Map of Literary Meanings,’ mapping the presence of the Bible in public spaces through a network analysis based on the periodical press, i.e. the most important media of the time.</p>

            <p>This network chart shows all the periodicals and the relationships of citations that appear in them. The larger circles represent periodicals, the smaller ones individual citations. The chart shows which citations appear in multiple periodicals. However, for the sake of clarity, citations are limited to those for which at least three occurrences within one periodical were recognised. We recommend observing both separate groups of citations specific to just one periodical as well as shared citations that are part of the common philosophy of several periodicals. Significant connections between media channels are found in the popular moral compass of the Ten Commandments – especially “<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>” and “<i>Thou shalt not commit adultery</i>,” which connect most periodicals. Gospel citations, on the other hand, divide the periodical press into several specific groups in a more complex way. Through the use of interactive filtering, we recommend exploring individual combinations, shared groups, as well as separate and unrelated periodicals and citations.</p>

            <p>A network chart showing all recognised biblical citations shared by at least two periodicals in the corpus used. Many of these citations appear only in two periodicals, but some, such as the one most quoted overall, “<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>,” or another commandment, “<i>Thou shalt not steal</i>,” appear across most of the periodicals surveyed. This example makes it possible to better track shared citations using their clusters. The number of occurrences in each periodical for each citation is shown by the thickness of the line representing the link to the periodical (edges). A specific situation of biblical citations with low interconnectedness occurs in <i>Moravský hospodář</i> (<i>The Moravian Farmer</i>), an economic and educational periodical, as opposed to <i>Venkov</i> (<i>The Countryside</i>), a political periodical of the Agrarian Party. The situation of the periodical <i>Posel záhrobní</i> (<i>The Messenger from Beyond the Grave</i>), devoted to spiritualism, is highly specific, since it shares specific citations with individual periodicals only in smaller joint groups. It is also interesting to observe the links in individual groups of citations between <i>Venkov</i> and the clearly Catholic periodical <i>Čech</i> (<i>The Bohemian</i>) and <i>Věstník katolického duchovenstva</i> (<i>The Catholic Clergy Gazette</i>), where participation in a broad common philosophy – at least as far as biblical citations are concerned – is manifested.</p>

            <p>A network chart showing how many verse references are shared between the periodicals (the thickness of the edge shows the ratio of shared citations to the total number of citations in both periodicals, using the following calculation:   </p>
        </div>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
ratio_of_shared_verses = shared_verses/(verses_in_A + verses_in_B - shared_verses)
                </code>
            </pre>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>In absolute numbers, the most quoted verses are shared by the Catholic <i>Čech</i> and <i>Věstník katolického duchovenstva</i> (271), similarly again <i>Čech</i> and the Agrarian <i>Venkov</i> (264). In this respect, it is interesting to note that <i>Věstník katolického duchovenstva</i> and <i>Venkov</i> do not have such significant overlap (113). The highest ratio of shared quoted verses is between <i>Čech</i> and <i>Věstník katolického duchovenstva</i> (16.3%). They are closely followed, perhaps a bit surprisingly, by <i>Moravský večerník</i> (<i>Moravian Evening Post</i>) from Olomouc and the pro-Republican and pro-democratic <i>Přítomnost</i> (14.5%, 61 total), and <i>Moravský večerník</i> and <i>Venkov</i> (13.9%, 135 total). When interpreting the chart, it is necessary to take into account that the calculation is based on the total number of citations in both linked journals. Thus, although the chart shows that <i>Moravský hospodář</i> shares only 2% of citations with <i>Venkov</i>, <i>Venkov</i> in fact contains up to 100% of the citations that appear in <i>Moravský hospodář</i>. However, this is due to the fact that only two citations could be detected in the entire corpus of <i>Moravský hospodář</i>.</p>

            <p>A network chart that allows you to filter the view according to the total number of recognised biblical citations. Its basic version displays the thresholded groups of all citations that appear at least 3 times in the whole corpus. By making a selection in the chart, however, the display can be narrowed down to relationships based on groups of 6–10 citations (11–15, 16–20, more than 20). This view provides a better understanding of the quantitative and qualitative nature of the links to biblical textuality based on the number of members and content of each group, as well as the extent of the links.</p>
